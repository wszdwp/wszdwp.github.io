# Moral reasoning  
Moral: The principles and beliefs concerning right and wrong behaviour.

Two modes of moral reasoning  
1. Consequentialist - locates morality in the consequences of an act  
2. Categorical - locates morality in certain duties and rights regardless of the consequences  

**Utilitarianism** (by Jeremy Bentham) vs **Categorical Reasoning** (by Emmanuel Kant) 

## Utilitrarianism    
Utilitrarianism (by Jeremy Bentham) : the right thing, the just thing to do is to maximize utility, 
    the balance of plesure over pain, or the general welfare, or hapiness.  
```
Utility = The sum of hapiness - The sum of suffering or Pain
```

- Pros:  

- Cons: Different people have different standards in viewing pleasures. Some pleasures are higher.

- Qustions:  
1. Do we have certain fundamental rights?  
2. Does a fair procedure justify any results?  
3. What is the moral work of consent?  

Refs: Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill  

Two objections to Utilitarianism
1. Fail to respect individual / minority rights  
2. Not possible to aggreate all values into money  

John Stuart Mill Replied those objections. **Utility is the only standard for moral.**  
How to ? Is it possible distiguish higher from lower pleasures? how qualitatively di
 - When you tried both of them, you prefer the higher pleasures naturally.  
 - In the long run, if we do justice and if we respect rights, society as whole will be better.  

How to answer rights and justice?  
Is there any other reason to overturn mill's idea?  

Some stronger theory of rights, respecting individual but not using them.

## Libertarianism
** Libertarianism** the fundamental individual right is the right to liberty.  
 - Individual matters and cannot be used by the society's desire or devise.
 - A right to choose freely, to live our lives as we please provided we respect other people's rights to do the same.

View of government from the libertarian
1. No paternalist legislation (eg: aganist safe belts laws, by law is coercion)  
2. No morals legislation  
3. No redistribution of income from rich to poor  

Robert Nozick's argument against taxiation   
```
Taxation = taking of earnings = forced labor = slavery
``` 
** Self-Possesion - We are the owners or proprietors of our own person and that's why Utilitrarianism goes wrong **
